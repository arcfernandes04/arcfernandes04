## Repos/Projects
*I know my GitHub is pretty empty, so please feel free to get in contact with me to talk more about my past/potential projects! 
There are some that I haven't listed here because some resources were licensed for academic use only. And, I have some cool ideas for projects that I just don't quite have the time to get stuck into yet :)*
* ANDIE - A non-destructive image editor built for a group project assignment. ANDIE was built using Java, from a base project provided by our lectures. Although a great starting point, we found that building on top of, and understanding and solving issues within this existing code as a group was a valuable learning experience in collaborating with other programmers, both within and external to your team.
